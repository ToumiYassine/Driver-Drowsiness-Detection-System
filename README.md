# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
Driver Drowsiness Detection System :
1-creation of a cnn model for classifying the state of the eyes while driving the car (closed or open) using Tensorflow and Keras .
2-In this type of detection, I do not use classic detection algorithms like yolo, I use xml files which are  a pre-trained face detector, provided by the developers and maintainers of the OpenCV library (haarcasade_frontalface_default.xml and haarcasade_eye.xml).
3-Develop code using the opencv library to detect the state of eyes and integrate a counter and an alert.
4-Deoploy using Streamlit.
